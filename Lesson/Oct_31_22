CPU: Central processing unit
Memory RAM: Can have an Instruction Table: Each command has a seperate number 
The RAM address is the last four bits of an instruction
Control Unit (CU): Controls the registers
Computer follows four phases:
  Fetch: Gets code 
  Decode: The RAM address is translated to identify which register it came from 
  Execute: It runs the program
